## dark_matter.py (not tested)
It's a script for automated black matter inserting into player accounts.
Player transfers SBD or STEEM to the @Steemnova account and the rest is handled by this little monster
### TO DO
- change loaded transactions limit or change it totally if ther's better way
- change black matter multiplier to adequate digits (*10 for exqmple or even more... guys?)
- need to adjust multiplier depending on currency SBD or STEEM 
- handle the excepotions handlers
- make more data validation to prevent injections & negative numbers
- take a nap.
